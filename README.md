# Gil Transferer

A plugin to facilitate transfering gils between alts within a single Service account.<br/>
Relies on TextAdvance, YesAlready, Lifestream and AutoRetainer.

This plugin lets you transfert gils from all of you alts on a single service account to your main character easily.
It will teleport to one of your friend's (or alt) estate (FC, Private, Apartments) and enter it to then buy a configured slot on a mannequin.

For this plugin to work, you will need an external character to act as a teleportation middleman ("external character" meaning a character on another service account).
This is because you can not send a friend request to a character on the same service account, and you need to be able to teleport to a friend's estate for this plugin to work.
This plugin works best with FCs, but you can also use it with apartments and private estates, although it will be more tedious.

For this, you will need to either:
1) Be in a FC and have a FC Room purchased on your main. Then, send a friend request to one of your FC members in the same FC on all of your alts.
2) Subscribe a second service account for one month, create a character there and join the same FC as your main character. Then add all your alts as friends on this character.

The plugin will then ask you to fill in the name of the character where you want to TP (in this case, the "TP middleman" -> your friend/second service account).
During process, every alt will then open the estate list of the configured TP middleman and TP to its Free Company estate.
It will then enter the FC, go to the right FC room (typically your Main Character's FC room) and then buy items from a mannequin.

If you do not have a FC, you can use Apartments or a Private estate, but then all the gils will be collected by the TP middleman, since it will be their estate (Subject to improvements in the future).
